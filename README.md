# CRUD_SYS is a simple todo app with a mix of photo viewing

### Do the following to use the application in your local machine:
**Use these to install the dependencies:**

## Client:
**npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled** 
**framer-motion**
**npm i react-icons**

## Server: 
**npm i express**
**npm install cors**
**npm install bodyparser**
**npm install node-fetch**

## Remember to install both React library as well using - *npx install create-react-app app-name* 
## then jump into your subdirectory: **cd app-name** and run **npm start**

## Run *npm start* on crud_client and separately on crud_sys dir

*Still faced challenges with the proxy server. Tried **http-proxy-middleware** and manually injecting the proxy*
*but it only reads data and not accept incoming requests*
